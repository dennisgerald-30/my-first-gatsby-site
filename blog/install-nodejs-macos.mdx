Hello Front End Developers !

Here is the guide to every new Mac users interested in Front End Development. Basic step to any front end developers interested to use React JS is to install Node JS and NPM. You can install NodeJS in macOS through two methods.

## BREW vs Downloader

<br/>
<br/>

** Installing NodeJS through BREW **

>It is really easy and recommended installing NodeJS through BREW with a simple one line command on the terminal.
>
>All you got to do is open the terminal and enter this command

<CodeBlock> brew install node </CodeBlock>

Note: BREW needs to be installed. To check if its installed please open the TERMINAL and type

<CodeBlock> brew -v</CodeBlock>

** Another method to install Node JS is using downloader **

Visit the official Node JS download site <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>

If you are a newbie I would recommend (even node recommends) to stick latest LTS version rather than current one as some of the dependencies that we will use in our project might not work properly with Current one.
